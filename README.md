# Transport for London Status Checker

This is little project I'm using to gain experience working with vanilla Javascript and APIs. This site uses the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/) to get detailed information about the Transport for London travel network, this is then parsed to enable the display ofeach line status.

The website follows the official TFL style guide for status updates, which can be found [here](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tube-status-presentation-user-guide.pdf).
